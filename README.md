# RUL_Prediction -

- **Implemented an ensemble-based predictive maintenance model using a Random Forest Regressor to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines.**
- **Developed base models leveraging deep learning techniques, including Bi-GRU, Bi-TRNN, Bi-LSTM, DCNN, and ProgNet, achieving competitive RMSE scores between 13 and 15 across datasets of varying complexity.**
- **Utilized sensor data (temperature, pressure, speed) to identify early indicators of engine failure and visualized degradation patterns.**
- **Applied time-series analysis, feature engineering, and deep learning models within an ensemble framework to accurately estimate the remaining operational life of aircraft engines.**
