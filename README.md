# RUL_Prediction - 
• Implemented a random forest regressor to ensemble base models for predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of aircraft engines.
• Developed base models using deep learning techniques including Bi-GRU, Bi-TRNN, Bi-LSTM, DCNN, and ProgNet, achieving competitive RMSE scores ranging from 13 to 15 across multiple datasets with varying complexities.
• Developed a predictive maintenance model to estimate the remaining operational life of aircraft engines.
• Employed deep learning models as base learners within an ensemble framework to capture intricate
degradation patterns in engine performance.
• Explored various sensor data, including temperature, pressure, and speed, to identify early indicators of
engine failure and Visualized the same .
• Implemented techniques such as time-series analysis, feature engineering, and model ensembling
(Bi-LSTM, Bi-TRNN, DCNN, Bi-GRU, ProgNet) to enhance prediction accuracy.
